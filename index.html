            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">The Problem<br>The Keep San Antonio Beautiful Website is intended to provide information about how to protect the San Antonio environment and give users an opportunity to donate to or volunteer with the organization. <br><br>
            We observed that the website was not communicating these things effectively due to broken links, a confusing navigation menu, and poor page layouts. This was causing confusion and frustration when users would try to navigate the website. <br><br>
            Why Does It Matter? <br> Residents of San Antonio who used the site described the organization as untrustworthy, and they did not feel motivated to get involved.

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>In our redesign, we wanted to accomplish three main goals:</p>
            <p>Goal 1 - Improve the information architecture and navigation system so users can access information efficiently. </p>
            <p>Goal 2 - Include real-world photos and stories capturing the impact the organization has made around the community to boost credibility. </p>
            <p>Goal 3 - Make volunteering and donating through the website simple and intuitive to increase involvement. </p>

    <!--Research-->

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>To gain a more comprehensive understanding of usability issues and pain points, we conducted five usability tests on the current website. The tests revealed that users were confused by the main navigation menu, they did not like the cluttered layout of the pages, and they did not trust the organization enough to donate or get involved. But we wanted to get to the root of the problem to find the exact user interface issues that were causing pain points, so I worked with my team to annotate the homepage with notes regarding usability issues, accessibility issues, and heuristic issues.

We addressed these issues by implementing our new sitemap, including call-to-action buttons, and incorporating the “Our Impact” section to inspire users to get involved.  </p>

                <h4>Challenges & Conclusion</h4>
                <p>After testing our mobile prototype, we realized that the navigation menu had some issues. We had already made some changes to it, and after testing our prototype, realized that we still needed to make a few tweaks. (Example - change Programs to Volunteer)
                That meant we needed to card sort and create a sitemap. We had to backtrack to the ideation phase, but it ended up making our end result so much more clear, and we felt confident that our design decisions were based on our testing insights. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we accomplished the goals we set out to achieve. With our new design, ALL participants we tested felt that the organization seemed credible, and they were motivated to get involved with the organization after viewing our homepage.
